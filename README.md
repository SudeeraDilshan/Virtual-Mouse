# Virtual Mouse Using Hand Gestures

This project allows you to control your computer's mouse using hand gestures captured by a webcam. It uses OpenCV for video capture, MediaPipe for hand detection, and PyAutoGUI for controlling the mouse cursor. The project detects the movement of your index finger and thumb to simulate mouse movements and clicks.

## Requirements

You need to install the following dependencies to run the project:

- `opencv-python`
- `mediapipe`
- `PyAutoGUI`
- `protobuf`

You can install all dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
